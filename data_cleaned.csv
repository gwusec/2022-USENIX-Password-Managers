I use that password for any account I set up thats for something GW related unless for some reason I cannot. I know that's a bad system, but it's the system I use.

Accounts that I rarely use and don't care about--say for a store I think I may only ever buy something from once, or something--I'll have the browser create and remember the password, and then I'll just reset the password if I'm using a different device and the password doesn't transfer. I write a password down on a sticky note if it is device specific and I am irritated about the way the password security is set up preventing me from creating a password I can remember.;managing passwords is a nightmare and I always feel like the more secure a password is from a cybersecurity standpoint the more likely it is that I can't remember it, and also I don't have time to change my passwords every three months or whatever, good lord.;I used two lines from a song that captured the emotional state I associate with working at GW to create a 16-character string of letters and numbers;It seems reasonably random, is on the long side, and yet I can remember it.;No;Somewhat more secure;"I don't want a student hacking into my GW account.

 I use the second strategy when it is automatic (but I rarely *choose* to save my passwords in a browser). In other words, some programs simply open when I click on them, so I presume the password has been saved somewhere.
 Occasionally (very rarely these days), when I find that I need to create a password that will only be used for a very specific program (i.e. does not benefit from the single-signon system), I might write it down if I know I'm going to have to use it again soon and it is a trickier than usual (for me) combination.
